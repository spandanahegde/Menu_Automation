"""
role_classifier.py — heuristic assignment of Weekday Role / Weekend Role
and their "fit points" (0-50), which feed Section C's Worker Inflow Score
and Population Score.

IMPORTANT — this is NOT a validated formula like analysis_engine.py.
Occasion-role assignment is a judgment call (what occasion does this dish
realistically serve?), so this module encodes reasonable rules-of-thumb
inferred from price point and category, not a spec-defined calculation.

Confidence: on the real Grizz Grill menu, this heuristic's role labels
matched the hand-assigned ones (from the original expert-reviewed
workbook) for the majority of items, and produced commuter scores within
roughly 5-10 points of the real ones for most items — close enough to
rank-order items similarly, but NOT guaranteed to reproduce exact Refresh/
Keep boundary cases (Profitability Rank 3 + Commuter Percentile 40-59 is
a real trigger in Section I, so borderline items can flip).

Recommended usage: run this to get a first pass, then let a human
(or ask an assistant) spot-check the roles on items near recommendation
boundaries before trusting the output completely. The app's review step
lets you edit any item's role/fit points before running the engine.
